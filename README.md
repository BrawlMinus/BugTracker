# Brawl Minus Bug Tracker #
 This is the official brawl minus bug tracker. Here you can make bug reports, actively contribute to discussions on features and changes, as well as keep up to date on the current progress of bugs and their priority.
## Rules: ##
 - Don't use Dev reserved tags in your issues.
 - Do not report bugs or crashes when using a modified minus build (this includes cosmetic changes)
 - Give as much info as possible when reporting.
 - Be polite and respect the wishes of the developers. While this is a place you can discuss changes with devs, use common sense. Rules from the forum all apply here as well.
 - Do not request features or changes that have already been discussed with developers. 
 - Check to make sure an issue hasn't already been opened before making a new one.
 - Do not ask for help running or setting up the game, that's what the forums are for.
